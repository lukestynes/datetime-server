# DateTime-Server

This is a project created for a Computer Networking assignment using python socket programming and UDP ports.

You launch the server on a machine and specify which ports you will listen to requests for for different languages.

You then launch the client on another machine, enter the whether you want the date or time, the address, and the port which relates to the language you want. This will return a read out of the current date/time in 1 of 3 languages.

### Running the Program
1. Run the server using `python server.py`
2. Run the client using `python client.py`
