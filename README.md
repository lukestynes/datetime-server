This is a project created for COSC264 - Computer Networking assignment using Python socket programming and UDP ports.

You launch the server on a machine and specify which ports you will listen to requests for different languages.

You then launch the client on another machine and enter whether you want the date or time, the address, and the port which relates to the language you want. This will return a readout of the current date/time in 1 of 3 languages.
